budget data type implementation: A budget should be a model with just start date, end date, and amount. A budget instance is an atomic unit, regardless if it's a month-long or week-long budget. For example, say a budget is made for Jan 1 to Jan 31, that budget would only account for wholistic expense spent within that whole time range. If another expanse is made from Jan 3 to say Jan 27, it is a different expense than the earlier one.
Expense categories:- food, transportation, events, miscellaneous, housing, etc. This enables user get a statistics what he spents the most amount on over a period.
