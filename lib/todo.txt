Allow for user to enter budgets, e.g., dailyBudget, WeeklyBudgets, MonthlyBudget. Then based on this, users should be able to generate reports (daily, weekly, monthly) where each report highlights most expensive item bought, day with the most expenses, if budget is less/greater than expense.

budget data type implementation: A budget should be a model with just start date, end date, and amount. A budget instance is an atomic unit, regardless if it's a month-long or week-long budget. For example, say a budget is made for Jan 1 to Jan 31, that budget would only account for wholistic expense spent within that whole time range. If another expanse is made from Jan 3 to say Jan 27, it is a different expense than the earlier one.
Expense categories:- food, transportation, events, miscellaneous, housing, etc. This enables user get a statistics what he spents the most amount on over a period.
Make available, option to blank sheet for expense and/or income either monthly or daily. As of v1.0, the default is daily for expenses and monthly for income, owing to the fact that most times, people spend more times than the they get, an exception is a case of a user who uses the app for their business i.e., to record sales
